# Shell-scripts

A growing collection of Bash scripts for DevOps & SysAdmin tasks  
(by Istiak / istiak-devsecops)

---

## Overview

This repo is a **work in progress** — I regularly add new scripts as I learn, practice, and solve real problems.  
Think of it as a living toolbox for Linux automation: log monitoring, cleanup, backups, and more.

If you’re a sysadmin, DevOps engineer, or developer managing Linux servers, you might find some ready-to-use helpers here — or just ideas to build your own.

## Current Scripts

Here are the scripts currently included (list will grow over time):

| Script name | Purpose |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| `log_monitor.sh` | Watch logs (e.g. error spikes) and alert/report |
| `log_rotating.sh` | Rotate logs, compress, and manage old log files |
| … | more coming soon |

*(Check back often — new scripts are added regularly.)*
